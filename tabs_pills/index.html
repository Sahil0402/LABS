                <h3>Task</h3>
                <p class="desc">The task is to create a responsive website that showcases the importance of SDP,
                    EDI, DT, and Course projects in VIT. This website should use toggleable or dynamic tabs/pills and be
                    designed with Bootstrap and JQuery. </p>

                <p class="desc">Software engineering combines computer science and engineering to create reliable
                    software in a systematic, controlled, and efficient manner. It involves using formal methods for
                    specification, evaluation, analysis and design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Due to the
                    complexity of software products, software engineering requires analytical tools from computer
                    science and the rigor of engineering disciplines to ensure reliability and security. A software
                    engineering curriculum can be approached from either a computer science-first or software
                    engineering-first perspective, with merit in both approaches. Successful software engineering
                    requires teamwork to satisfy timing, size, and security requirements within budgets.</p>

                <p class="desc">Project Centric Learning (PCL) is an effective tool for students to work on projects
                    that align with their interests and strengths. PCL includes semester-long courses where students can
                    solve real-world problems using technology. Domains can include healthcare, agriculture, defense,
                    education, smart cities, energy, and cleanliness. PCL requires students to acquire relevant skills
                    through online courses and guidance from faculty. By preparing students for a project-based world,
                    PCL promotes active and inquiry-based learning, redefines the teacher's role, and utilizes Bloom's
                    Taxonomy.</p>

                <p class="desc">Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that prioritizes empathy, creativity, and
                    experimentation. It is a human-centered process that aims to understand people's needs, identify
                    problems, and develop solutions that are practical, effective, and feasible.
                    The design thinking process typically involves the following stages:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Empathize: Understanding the needs, wants, and behaviors of the people who will use the product
                        or service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Define: Reframe the problem by defining the core issue based on user needs and insights.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ideate: Generate a wide range of ideas through brainstorming and exploration of different
                        solutions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prototype: Build mock-ups or prototypes of potential solutions to test and refine ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test: Collect feedback and data from users to refine and improve the prototypes.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p class="desc">Course projects are small-scale projects that are completed within the context of a
                    specific course or subject area. These projects allow students to apply the concepts and skills they
                    have learned in the classroom to real-world scenarios within the subject domain. Course projects can
                    take many forms, such as research papers, presentations, programming assignments, or group projects.
                    They provide an opportunity for students to deepen their understanding of the course material and
                    develop practical skills that are relevant to their future careers. Course projects are often guided
                    by instructors and may involve collaboration with peers, providing a valuable opportunity for
                    teamwork and networking.
